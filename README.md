# Django CMS Tutorial

The tutorial requires you to install a pre-built "polls" application but I found this didn't work due to deprecated code so instead I copied their polls app but replaced a lot of the code with my own from the django tutorial.

As a result in order to run this app you will need to install *[my polls app](https://github.com/Leyght811/django-polls-master)*
